This set of character sheets contains 4 separate versions of standard DnD 5E character sheets to play. They are all scripted to automatically fill most of relevant values that can be calculated from statistics, class and level. That includes modifiers, skills, and many more. Full list will be presented below. Additionally, next to skill proficiency checkmark there is *Expertise* checkmark, for any Rogues, Bards, or any other class to use. This as well automatically adds the additinal proficiency bonus to relevant value. 

**HOW TO USE**

Firstly, I recommend choosing your class and level you want your character to be on.
If you prefer to use custom class, instead of choosing from the list click on the field and type the name.
Then depending on the version you chose, fill your raw statistics into bottom, or top box.
(If your file name has "AbilityScoresTop" in it, raw statistics type into the top box. Modifier values will appear automatically in the bottom.
If you use "AbilityModifiersTop" version, put your statistics into the smaller, bottom box and modifiers will appear above)
After you insert these, only thing left to do is choose proficiencies and expertises by simply clicking on the circles or squares next to the ability's name.

**The way it works**

With basic values inserted, all the scripts are working. The file is now able to calculate the following values:
 - Saving throws bonus
 - Skill checks bonus
 - Initiative
 - Proficiency bonus
 - Passive perception
 - Spellcasting ability modifier
 - Spell save DC
 - Spell attack bonus
 - Number of known spells depending on your class, or the number of spells you can prepare
 - Amount of spell slots of each level that you can use on your level.

Additionally, if you chose Bard class, on level 2 and above Jack of All Trades bonus will be automatically added to all your skills you are not proficient with. You're welcome ;) 


**What is 'controll'?**

As you may have notices, there are two files with "_Controll". These files contain additional page at the very end of the file. It is a controll page, where you can add external bonuses to your statistics like Saving Throws, Initiative (Like 'Alert' feat) and others. This is not possible in standard version due to general automation of all calculations. This additional page only serves to correct those bonuses and does not need to be printed.
